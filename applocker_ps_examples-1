#These are just some examples of the main gears for interacting with AppLocker via PowerShell.
#If you want to use it you will need to write more code to make this a functional script. 
#This assumes AppLocker is being deployed via Group Policy Object (GPO) with Active Directory.
#
#Define the GPO that is being interacted with
$testgpo = "LDAP://domain.example.com/CN={GUID-GOES-HERE},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=domain,DC=example,DC=com"
#
#Get AppLocker event information from a server location (perhaps that has filtered forwarded logs).
#The where-object allows searching based off of AppLocker events that match a condition, in this case a portion of the path.
$event = Get-applockerfileinfomration -EventLog -logpath \\server\share\file.evtx | where-object {$_.path -like "*searchterm*"}
#
#Create a "candidate" AppLocker policy and saves it as a variable, which allows manipulation later.
#Note: this is just an example, you will probably want to write logic to select which event in the case of multiple matches.
#You will also probably want to change the type, user group, and prefix appropriately for your environment
$prepolicy = $($event | New-AppLockerPolicy -RuleType Publisher -User AppropriateUser -RuleNamePrefix Prefix)
#
#Set different variables in the policy for publisher based rules:

#Example Setting #1: Setting policy so there is no minimum version (lower than HighSection)
$prepolicy.RuleCollections.PublisherConditions.BinaryVersionRange.LowSection=$null
#
#Example Setting #2: Setting policy so there is no maximum version (higher than LowSection)
$prepolicy.RuleCollections.PublisherConditions.BinaryVersionRange.HighSection=$null
#
#To set the policy to allow for any version of the file, set both options to Null.
#
#Example Setting #3: Setting policy so any binary name will work
$prepolicy.RuleCollections.PublisherConditions.BinaryName="*"
#
#Example Setting #4: To set the productname to anything
$prepolicy.RuleCollections.PublisherConditions.ProductName="*"
#
#Once the desired configuration changes have been made, the policy can be merged to the current AD policy with the following:
Set-AppLockerPolicy -PolicyObject $prepolicy -Merge -LDAP $testgpo
